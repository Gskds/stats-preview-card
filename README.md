- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this fontend mentor challenge I learn the following things: How to arrange a grid element, How to make transparent color cover on image and also I'm able to make a grid columns with auto-fit but I don't get what I want in mobile version (i.e I couldn't make the width of the card right on mobile version but it works for desktop version, I don't now why??? please if someone knows I'm ready to learn .

here is the code snippet I use.

```css
.card {
grid-template-columns:reapet(anto-fit, minmax(min(35rem, 100%), 1fr));
;
```

### Continued development

I solve a couple of fontend mentors challenges. It helps me so much to solidify my knowledge on different topics, but same of the challenges quite hard to solve for me, specially re-creating a full home page. I try a couple of times but I can't do it. I want somebody to tell me how should I approach to do it, and what things should be consider before doing it???
